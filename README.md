 Tower Defence
 
 Guard your crops, feed your kingdom.
 
You are a court-licensed farmer who is responsible for feeding the kingdom. Thus, you work tirelessly each day to tend to your crops. However, recently, hungry goblins around the kingdom have started forming raid parties against your estate. Itâ€™s now your job to defend your yield in the night while continuing the sale of crops in the day. If you fail to do so, the court will evict and exile you from your homeland.
